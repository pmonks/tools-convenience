# tools-convenience

Various convenience fns for [tools.build](https://github.com/clojure/tools.build)-based build scripts.

**NOTE: This library almost certainly won't work on "raw" Windows, and it is unknown if it works on [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).**

## Using the library

### Dependency

Include a maven dependency on the library in your `deps.edn`, for a build tool alias:

```edn
  :aliases
    :build
      {:deps       {com.github.pmonks/tools-convenience {:mvn/version "LATEST_CLOJARS_VERSION"}}
       :ns-default your.build.ns}
```

### Require the Namespace

```clojure
(ns your.build.ns
  (:require [tools-convenience.api :as tc]))
```

### API Documentation

[API documentation is available here](https://pmonks.github.io/tools-convenience/).

### Developer Workflow

This project uses the [git-flow branching strategy](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), and the permanent branches are called `release` and `dev`.  Any changes to the `release` branch are considered a release and auto-deployed (JARs to Clojars, API docs to GitHub Pages, etc.).

For this reason, **all development must occur either in branch `dev`, or (preferably) in temporary branches off of `dev`.**  All PRs from forked repos must also be submitted against `dev`; the `release` branch is **only** updated from `dev` via PRs created by the core development team.  All other changes submitted to `release` will be rejected.

### Build Tasks

`tools-convenience` uses [`tools.build`](https://clojure.org/guides/tools_build). You can get a list of available tasks by running:

```
clojure -A:deps -T:build help/doc
```

Of particular interest are:

* `clojure -T:build test` - run the unit tests
* `clojure -T:build lint` - run the linters (clj-kondo and eastwood)
* `clojure -T:build ci` - run the full CI suite (check for outdated dependencies, run the unit tests, run the linters)
* `clojure -T:build install` - build the JAR and install it locally (e.g. so you can test it with downstream code)

Please note that the `deploy` task is restricted to the core development team (and will not function if you run it yourself).
